# Formal Analysis

## Overview

Formal analysis focuses on the visual elements and principles of design in an artwork, examining how these components work together to create meaning and aesthetic experience.

## Visual Elements

### Line
- Direction, quality (smooth, jagged, continuous)
- Creates movement, defines shapes, suggests emotion
- Contour lines, implied lines, gestural lines

### Shape and Form
- **Shape**: Two-dimensional (flat)
- **Form**: Three-dimensional (volume, mass)
- Geometric vs. organic
- Positive and negative space

### Color
- Hue, value, intensity/saturation
- Color schemes (complementary, analogous, monochromatic)
- Symbolic and emotional associations
- Light and shadow

### Texture
- Actual (physical) vs. implied (visual)
- Surface quality
- Contributes to realism or abstraction

### Space
- Foreground, middle ground, background
- Perspective (linear, atmospheric)
- Depth and dimension

## Principles of Design

### Balance
- Symmetrical, asymmetrical, radial
- Visual weight distribution

### Emphasis/Focal Point
- Areas of visual dominance
- Contrast, placement, scale

### Movement
- Visual flow and rhythm
- Repetition and pattern

### Unity and Variety
- Coherence among elements
- Visual interest through diversity

### Proportion and Scale
- Relative size relationships
- Hierarchical proportions

## Conducting Formal Analysis

1. **Observe**: Systematically examine all visual elements
2. **Describe**: Document what you see objectively
3. **Analyze**: Explain how elements interact and create effects
4. **Interpret**: Connect formal qualities to meaning and expression

## Example Questions

- What is the dominant visual element?
- How does the artist use color to create mood?
- What kind of balance does the composition employ?
- How do line and shape guide the viewer's eye?
