# Example Analysis: A Step-by-Step Demonstration

This section will provide detailed case studies demonstrating ACRE methodologies in practice.

## Coming Soon

We will include comprehensive analyses of artworks from various periods and cultures, showing how to apply:

- The four-step method (Description, Analysis, Interpretation, Evaluation)
- Formal analysis techniques
- Contextual research and interpretation
- Comparative analysis
- Multiple theoretical perspectives

## Planned Case Studies

1. **Ancient Art**: Analysis of Egyptian tomb painting
2. **Medieval Art**: Gothic cathedral sculpture program
3. **Renaissance**: Masaccio's "The Tribute Money"
4. **Baroque**: Caravaggio's use of chiaroscuro
5. **Romantic**: Caspar David Friedrich's landscape painting
6. **Modern**: Picasso's "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"
7. **Contemporary**: Installation or performance art

## Structure of Each Case Study

Each analysis will follow this format:

### 1. Initial Encounter
- First impressions
- Basic information (artist, title, date, medium, location)

### 2. Description
- Detailed visual inventory
- Subject matter
- Composition

### 3. Formal Analysis
- Elements of art (line, color, shape, texture, space)
- Principles of design (balance, emphasis, movement, unity, proportion)

### 4. Contextual Research
- Historical context
- Biographical context
- Cultural context
- Art historical context

### 5. Interpretation
- Symbolism and iconography
- Themes and meanings
- Multiple interpretive possibilities

### 6. Evaluation
- Effectiveness of formal choices
- Historical significance
- Contemporary relevance

### 7. Reflection
- What this analysis reveals about the ACRE method
- Challenges encountered
- Questions remaining

## How to Use Case Studies

- Read actively, with the artwork image visible
- Try analyzing the work yourself before reading the provided analysis
- Notice how different sections of the analysis build upon each other
- Consider how you might apply similar strategies to other artworks
- Use these examples as templates for your own analytical writing
